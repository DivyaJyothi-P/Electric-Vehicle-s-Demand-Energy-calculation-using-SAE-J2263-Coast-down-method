# Electric-Vehicle-s-Demand-Energy-calculation-using-SAE-J2263-Coast-down-method
This project estimates the **vehicle demand energy**, **road load power** and **kinematic power** using the **SAE J2263 coast down method**. The analysis is performed for multiple standard drive cycles,including:
-FTP(Federal Test procedure)
-Highway Drive Cycle
-USO6
-SCO3
##Project Highlights
-Used **SAE J2263 coast down coefficients** to model realistic vehicle road load 
-Calculated:
-Total tractive force
-Road load power(rolling+aerodynamic+fixed resistance)
-Kinematic power(related to vehicle acceleration)
-Analyzed energy variation across different drive cycles
-Plotted and compared the results to understand the behavior
-Compared the results with Excel calculation
## Tools Used
-MATLAB R2025a
-Coast down constants(A,B,c)
-Microsoft Excel
-FTP,Highway,USO6,SCO3 Drive Cycle data

## Cost Down Equation
The vehicle road load force is calculated using the coast down formula :
**F=A+B.V+C.V^2**
where:
-A=rolling resistance
-B=friction
-C=Aerodynamic drag
-V=Vehicle velocity
## Vehicle Demand Energy Equation
The vehicle demand energy is calculated using this Equation
**VDE=âˆ‘[(TWC.ai+A+B.V+C.V^2 )*Distancei]**
where:
-TWC =Test weight class
-a=acceleration
-A=rolling resistance
-B=friction
-C=Aerodynamic drag
-V=Vehicle velocity
